During the testing of the TestNG the website (Expedia) it kept blocking the automated test and showing no results when trying to type or search for anything, and after restarting it prompted a "Verify Human" test which cannot be solved using any automated test software. 
Even when we tried to remove apart from the automated test and do it manually, it still did not show any results since we were in the automated test browser mode.
Thanks for your time,
